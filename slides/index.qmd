## Context  

- Participation in the 1st round of nowcasting in 2023  
- Five statisticians from Insee across different teams:  
  - 2 from economic studies  
  - 1 from short-term statistics  
  - 2 from the innovation lab  
- Economists (modeling) and data scientists (reproducibility)  
- Side project with limited time allocation  

::: {.callout-tip}  
## Main objective for Insee 
Explore new techniques and assess their feasibility for production implementation.  
:::  

## Data Used  

- Reused the exact same pipeline as in 2023, but with different data  
- Challenge constraint: Only open-source data allowed  
- Four types of data:  
  - Macroeconomic data from the Eurostat database  
  - Financial data from the Yahoo database  
  - Google Trends data  
  - Other data sources  

## Models Used  

- Decision to combine both econometric and ML models:  
  - RegARIMA  
  - Exponential model  
  - Dynamic Factor Models  
  - XGBoost  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model  

## Pros and cons 

| Model         | Pros                                              | Cons                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **ETS**      | Simple, interpretable                           | Limited external variables           |
| **TRAMO**    | Simple, interpretable | Limited external variables |
| **Dynamic Factor Models**    | Handles missing values, supports mixed frequencies | Forecasting is not its primary focus |
| **LSTM**  | Well-suited for time series, captures long-term dependencies | Slow to run, black box |
| **XGBOOST**     | Good interpretability, strong performance       | Not suitable for extrapolation       |

## A Reproducibility Challenge

- A [**reproducibility prize**]{.orange} for the challenge  
- Reproducibility of project very important in official statistics

- Gaining expertise in [**good computing practices**]{.orange}  
  + Contribution of the [**Insee Innovation Lab**]{.blue2} to the challenge 
  + [**Dissemination**]{.blue2} within Insee  
  + [**Reuse**]{.blue2} for internal projects  
  + Highlighting [**open-source**]{.blue2} projects  


## üöÄ Architecture Built  

- **Leveraged SSP Cloud** for computation and storage  
- **Chose R over Python** to enhance reusability within Insee  
- **Tech stack designed for maximum reproducibility** üìå:  
  - üèó **Git & GitHub** for version control  
  - üì¶ **renv** to manage R libraries  
  - üìÅ **Structured project workflow** with `{targets}` pipelines  
  - üê≥ **Docker** for environment portability  
  - ü§ñ **Automation** using GitHub Actions
